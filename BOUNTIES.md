# Bounty Tickets

Bounty tickets are an incentive to participation in our projects, eligible to all contributors, with the following disclaimer:

1. The compensation associated with the bounty is not a remuneration for work or services, and does not constitute a relationship between CaravanaCloud and the bounty claimer.

2. The compensation associated with your bounties can be claimed monthly, exclusively through GitHub Sponsors or Bountysource.

3. The claimer is responsible for all taxes and fees legally applicable in their country.

Look for the "bounty" tag in our issues and happy hunting!

# F.A.Q.

*How much is a bounthy worth?*

Unless tagged with another value, a bounty is associated with a reward of $50 EUR.

*When can a bounty be claimed?*

A bounty can be claimed anytime after the work is done and the ticket is closed.
Please note that the bounty ticket is just a maker, the actual work may be associated with many tickets.

*When is a ticket done?*

A ticket is done once the work has been reviewed, merged and the ticket is closed.
This includes any testing and verification related to the task in execution.

*How long does it take for a review?*

The expected review time is under one week.
Any reviews waiting feedback for more than two weeks can be considered accepted and merged by any contributor.

*How long do i have to complete a bounty ticket?* 

There is no fixed time limit to turn in tickets. 
However, if you are stuck, please seek help and join the office-hours meeting.

*How many bounty tickets can one tak?* 

It's usually better to work on one ticket at a time, or two at most.
This is better for one's focus and to leave tickets available for other fellow collaborators.

*Anything else?*
