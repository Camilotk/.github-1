# Bounties Program

We incitivize people to contribute to project development by associating rewards to tickets.
This is not meant as a contract or labor relationship of any kind. 
Bouties are a simple incentive to motivate people to practice and take the next step in their careers through open-source projects.

# Eligibility

To claim a ticket, one must:

* Be able to communicate in basic written english.
  Prefer english in all descriptions and comments to promote international collaboration.

* Have an account and be able to receive rewards on [algora.io](https://algora.io)

* Check that you are on the GitHub team:
  https://github.com/orgs/CaravanaCloud/teams/caravana-cloud
  Request access to the GitHub team or any other necessary tool using our [discord #help channel] (https://discord.gg/SEnMwASXzV) 

* Be the single assignee of the ticket. 
  Please assign the ticket to yourself if you plan to claim a ticket.
  Please be considerate of others and avoid assigning more than 2-3 tickets at time.
  Tickets idle for more than 30 days may be reassigned.

* Elaborate the ticket description, comments and information.
  Some tickets are created with a very brief comment.
  It's up to the assignee to add enough detail to make the work on the ticket understandable to reviewerss.

* The ticket is explicitily approved by one or more reviewers.

If your ticket meets this criteria, you are welcome to submit your claim.

Currently, all bounties are assigned the fixed value of $20. No extras will be paid under any circumstances, including taxes and expenses of the assignee.
