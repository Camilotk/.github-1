Bounty tickets are an incentive to participation in our projects, eligible to all contributors, with the following disclaimer:

1. The compensation associated with the bounty is not a remuneration for work or services, and does not constitute a relationship between CaravanaCloud and the bounty claimer.

2. The compensation associated with your bounties can be claimed monthly, exclusively through GitHub Sponsors or Bountysource.

3. The claimer is responsible for all taxes and fees legally applicable in their country.

Look for the "bounty" tag in our issues and happy hunting!
